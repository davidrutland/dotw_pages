Of course, this blog will be updated much more frequently and continue to be the home to thoughts, development, images, and frustrations.</p><figure class="post__image"><figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img src="https://davidrutland.uk/media/posts/9/steam_page-3.png" alt="Steam page for Day of the Worms" width="1920" height="1038" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://davidrutland.uk/media/posts/9/responsive/steam_page-3-xs.png 300w, https://davidrutland.uk/media/posts/9/responsive/steam_page-3-sm.png 480w, https://davidrutland.uk/media/posts/9/responsive/steam_page-3-md.png 768w, https://davidrutland.uk/media/posts/9/responsive/steam_page-3-lg.png 1024w, https://davidrutland.uk/media/posts/9/responsive/steam_page-3-xl.png 1360w, https://davidrutland.uk/media/posts/9/responsive/steam_page-3-2xl.png 1600w"></figure><figcaption>Caption</figcaption></figure></figure><p>Â </p></div><aside class="content__aside"><div class="content__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on May 14, 2025</div><div class="content__share"></div></aside><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://davidrutland.uk/authors/david-rutland/" title="David Rutland">David Rutland</a></h4></div></div><nav class="content__nav box"><div class="content__nav__prev"><a href="https://davidrutland.uk/second-area-background-art/" class="content__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://davidrutland.uk/media/posts/8/responsive/main_background_720-2xl-xs.png" alt="Pen drawing of an allotment path complete with bathtub toilet, fence, weeds, and gate.
