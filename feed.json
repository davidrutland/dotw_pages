This allows the player to click on objects wherever they are on the y axis.</p>\n<p>Likewise, I think having object and hotspot descriptions visible on a simple mouseover will be distracting, especially when the player has already read the description and knows what it is and does.</p>\n<p>Everything in the world that has a description can be looked at with the right mouse button. There are no pop-ups, and triggering the description by looking at the object or hotspot has to be a conscious decision. That you can trigger another action is indicated by the cursor showing an eye, hand, or mouth.</p>\n<p>Inventory objects are another matter. The player has their inventory open for a reason, and being able to scan quick desciptions is important, and can give clues to gameplay. For instance, is a bucket full of water or empty? Inventory mouseover pops the gActionBar at the bottom to give a quick description of what the object is. Using right-click (usually the Look action) to display text would block the action - requiring two clicks in total, so now, right click does nothing. I figure that up to 12 words is easily enough for the action bar GUI.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><figure class=\"post__image\"><img  src=\"https://davidrutland.uk/media/posts/10/dotw_mouseover_popup-2-2.png\" alt=\"DotW screem showing tooltip at the bottom of the screen\" width=\"1282\" height=\"721\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://davidrutland.uk/media/posts/10/responsive/dotw_mouseover_popup-2-2-xs.png 300w ,https://davidrutland.uk/media/posts/10/responsive/dotw_mouseover_popup-2-2-sm.png 480w ,https://davidrutland.uk/media/posts/10/responsive/dotw_mouseover_popup-2-2-md.png 768w ,https://davidrutland.uk/media/posts/10/responsive/dotw_mouseover_popup-2-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://davidrutland.uk/media/posts/10/responsive/dotw_mouseover_popup-2-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://davidrutland.uk/media/posts/10/responsive/dotw_mouseover_popup-2-2-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure></figure>\n<p>The other advantage of this is that I don't need to define functions for each type of click on an inventory item, as everying is dealt with automatically.Â </p>",
