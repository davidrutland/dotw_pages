This allows the player to click on objects wherever they are on the y axis.</p><p>Likewise, I think having object and hotspot descriptions visible on a simple mouseover will be distracting, especially when the player has already read the description and knows what it is and does.</p><p>Everything in the world that has a description can be looked at with the right mouse button. There are no pop-ups, and triggering the description by looking at the object or hotspot has to be a conscious decision. That you can trigger another action is indicated by the cursor showing an eye, hand, or mouth.</p><p>Inventory objects are another matter. The player has their inventory open for a reason, and being able to scan quick desciptions is important, and can give clues to gameplay. For instance, is a bucket full of water or empty? Inventory mouseover pops the gActionBar at the bottom to give a quick description of what the object is. Using right-click (usually the Look action) to display text would block the action - requiring two clicks in total, so now, right click does nothing. I figure that up to 12 words is easily enough for the action bar GUI.</p><figure class="post__image"><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://davidrutland.uk/media/posts/10/dotw_mouseover_popup-2-2.png" alt="DotW screem showing tooltip at the bottom of the screen" width="1282" height="721" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://davidrutland.uk/media/posts/10/responsive/dotw_mouseover_popup-2-2-xs.png 300w, https://davidrutland.uk/media/posts/10/responsive/dotw_mouseover_popup-2-2-sm.png 480w, https://davidrutland.uk/media/posts/10/responsive/dotw_mouseover_popup-2-2-md.png 768w, https://davidrutland.uk/media/posts/10/responsive/dotw_mouseover_popup-2-2-lg.png 1024w, https://davidrutland.uk/media/posts/10/responsive/dotw_mouseover_popup-2-2-xl.png 1360w, https://davidrutland.uk/media/posts/10/responsive/dotw_mouseover_popup-2-2-2xl.png 1600w"></figure></figure><p>The other advantage of this is that I don't need to define functions for each type of click on an inventory item, as everying is dealt with automatically.Â </p></div><aside class="content__aside"><div class="content__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on May 14, 2025</div><div class="content__share"></div></aside><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://davidrutland.uk/authors/david-rutland/" title="David Rutland">David Rutland</a></h4></div></div><nav class="content__nav box"><div class="content__nav__prev"><a href="https://davidrutland.uk/dotw-steam-page-is-live/" class="content__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://davidrutland.uk/media/posts/9/responsive/steam_page-2-2xl-xs.png" alt="Screenshot of DoTW Steam page" height="865" width="1600"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>DoTW Steam page is live!</h5></div></a></div><div class="content__nav__next"><a href="https://davidrutland.uk/distractions-galore/" class="content__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Distractions galore!</h5></div><img src="https://davidrutland.uk/media/posts/11/responsive/glass-3-2xl-xs.png" alt="AGS interface with DOTW running" height="793" width="1600"></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">Authors</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><div><a href="https://davidrutland.uk/authors/david-rutland/" class="authors__title">David Rutland</a> <span class="u-small">Post: 15</span></div></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://davidrutland.uk/">Day of the Worms</a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
